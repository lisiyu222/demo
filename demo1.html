        <div id="text1">
            <p>This is a description of the scatter map of public and private universities. On this map, you will see two different colored dots representing different types of universities. The blue dots represent public schools, which are funded and operated by the government. This means they might have more sources of funding, typically charge lower fees, and often cater to a large number of students.</p>
    
            <p>On the other hand, the red dots represent private schools. Private schools are supported by private funds, donations, or tuition fees. These schools may offer a more specialized education, closely associated with a particular religion or educational philosophy. Since they are not government-funded, private schools might have higher tuition fees, but they may also offer more scholarships or financial aid opportunities.</p>
            
            <p>By looking at this scatter map, you can easily distinguish between public and private universities. This helps to understand the distribution of higher education in a region or country, as well as the ratio between public and private institutions.</p>

    <div class="flex-container">
    <div id="vis6"></div>
        <div id="text1"> 
            <p>This map delves deeply into the distribution density and geographical locations of American universities. Through the vivid red dots, we are given a comprehensive view of the geographical concentration trend of universities. Compared to the traditional representation of total quantities within states, it provides us with a more detailed perspective.

            <p>The title "University Location of USA" in the map clearly states its theme—it's a map detailing the specific locations of universities. At first glance, you're drawn to the various-sized red dots scattered across the map. These dots are not placed randomly but are precisely marked according to the actual locations of the universities. The size of the dots offers a clear picture: larger dots indicate regions with a higher concentration of universities, serving as educational hotspots; whereas smaller dots denote areas with fewer universities, but they still add color to the map.

            <p>Of particular note is the eastern coastal area where the red dots are noticeably more clustered, especially in the New England region, indicating it as a significant hub for higher education in the USA. In the Midwest, even though the universities are more spread out, their distribution still outlines some of the major cities and transportation hubs.
